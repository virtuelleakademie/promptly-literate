Like this, you will be more productive and possibly submit a far better thesis. AI tools will provide you very quickly with a structure or draft that you can then amend, improve and extend. The following rules apply:\n\n- You are expected to substantially amend, improve and extend the output of AI tools.\n- Critically assess the output of AI tools. They may sound convincing but could be completely wrong.\n- Add references in order to support the claims generated by AI tools.\n- Clearly state which AI tools you have used for which parts of your thesis.\n- Check your thesis for plagiarism. Some AI tools may simply copy entire sentences or paragraphs from other sources.\n\nRead the privacy policy of AI tools before you use them. Do not send confidential data or trade secrets to cloud-based AI tools.\n\n\n\n## Basic techniques\n\n\nIn this activity, you can explore various prompting guides for GPT models. They more or less all converge on the same set of techniques.\n\n## Tasks\n\n- Explore prompting, using both ChatGPT and the Playground. \n- Try the PromptTools Playground.\n- Try out SPARK. This is a good demonstration of using a knowledge base and document retrieval can allow you to create a QA tool.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Prompts\n\nTry revisiting the prompts you created in the previous activity. Given you current knowledge, can you improve them?\n:::\n\n\n## Prompting Guides\n\nThe general techniques are:\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Prompting Techniques\n- Numbered Steps: For sequential tasks.\n- Delimiters: To separate info (e.g. `\"`, \\`,, `'`, `|`, `#`, ...).\n- Few-shot prompting: Use a few examples for guidance.\n- Chain-of-thought: Interconnected prompts.\n- Role-based: Make the model assume a role (e.g. act like a tutor or advisor).\n- Success Tip: Iterate and refine prompts for peak performance.\n:::\n\n\n\nCombining these techniques, a template prompt for an LMM might look like this:\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n1) Role: who is being simulated?\n2) Task: what is to be done?\n3) Steps: what are the steps to complete the task?\n4) Context: what is the context of the task?\n5) Goal: what is the goal of the task?\n6) Format: what is the format of the output?\n:::\n\n\nAn example prompt for a chatbot might look like this:\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Feedback on a text\n`I want you to act as a harsh critic. Criticize what I give to you and show me where my argumentation is lacking. Start by asking me what text I would like feedback on. Then ask me questions about my context to create the best feedback possible. If you feel you have all the context necessary, think step by step when creating your feedback.`\n:::\n\n## Explore Prompting Guides\n\n- [Learn prompting](https://learnprompting.org/docs/intro): An incredibly comprehensive (and free) guide aimed at non-technical users.\n\n- [Prompting guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/): This is an excellent prompting guide by **DAIR.AI**\n(Democratizing Artificial Intelligence Research, Education, and Technologies). The guide is licensed under an MIT license.\n\n- [PromptTools Playground](https://prompttools.streamlit.app/): a web app that lets you play with various prompting techniques. You can use different LLMs, and even compare the results.\n\n\n- [SPARK: a retrieval-augmented chatbot](https://huggingface.co/spaces/amagastya/SPARK). It uses various prompting guides as its knowledge base.\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-caution}\n## Discussion ðŸ’¬ \n\n- What experiences did you have with prompting?\n- Did you find any of the techniques particularly useful?\n:::\n\n",
