When confronted with new and complex concepts, adding many and varied examples helps students better understand those concepts. I would like you to ask what concept I would like examples of, and what level of students I am teaching. You will look up the concept, and then provide me with four different and varied accurate examples of the concept in action.\n:::\n\n\n\n## Explore prompting techniques\n\nNow open the second activity to explore prompting techniques related to writing, learning and teaching: \n\n[üëâ Activity 2](../pages/activity-2-prompting-learning-teaching.html).\n\n# References {background-color=\"#2e3440\"}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::",
