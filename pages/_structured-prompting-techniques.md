# Structured Prompting Techniques for Academic Research

## Slide 1: Introduction to Prompting
- **Explanation**: Understanding the basics and importance of prompting in
  generative AI.

- **Key Point**: Prompting guides AI responses by providing context and examples.

---

## In-Context Learning (ICL)
- **Explanation**: Providing examples or context within the prompt itself.
- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Give a few examples.
  - *Example*: Translate the following sentences...
- **Zero-Shot Prompting**: No examples, relies on pre-trained knowledge.
  - *Example*: Translate the following sentence...

---

## Slide 3: ICL Practical Exercise
- **Activity**: Research Paper Abstract Analysis
  - Provide abstracts, create few-shot and zero-shot prompts.
  - Test prompts and compare results.

---

## Slide 4: Thought Generation
- **Explanation**: Encourages the model to show its reasoning process.
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**: Break down thinking into steps.
  - *Example*: Jack has two baskets...

---

## Slide 5: CoT Practical Exercise
- **Activity**: Critical Analysis of Research Methodology
  - Create CoT prompts to analyze methodology.
  - Share and discuss prompts.

---

## Slide 6: Decomposition Techniques
- **Explanation**: Breaking down complex tasks into manageable subtasks.
- **Least-to-Most Prompting**: Start simple, increase complexity.
  - *Example*: List items, calculate cost...
- **Plan-and-Solve Prompting**: Separate planning and execution phases.
  - *Example*: Understand the problem, devise a plan...

---

## Slide 7: Decomposition Practical Exercise
- **Activity**: Systematic Literature Review Breakdown
  - Create prompts for basic to complex tasks.
  - Discuss and apply plan-and-solve prompts.

---

## Slide 8: Evaluation and Security
- **Explanation**: Ensuring accuracy and safety in prompting.
- **Evaluating Outputs**: Assess accuracy and relevance.
- **Security Measures**: Identify and mitigate risks.

---

## Slide 9: General Workshop Tips
1. Start with explanations and relevance.
2. Facilitate discussions post-activities.
3. Encourage application to specific research areas.
4. Create a collaborative document for sharing.
5. Final reflection session on useful techniques.
