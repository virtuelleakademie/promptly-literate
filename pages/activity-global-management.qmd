Designing effective prompts to instruct LLMS to generate a desired output is referred to as _prompt engineering_. This activity will guide you through the process of creating prompts for LLMs.

## Prompting Guidelines



In this activity, you can explore various prompting guides for LLMs. They more or less all converge on the same set of techniques. You can then use these techniques to write your own prompts

OpenAI give a set of [{{< bi link >}} strategies](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/six-strategies-for-getting-better-results)  for using their models.


These include:

- writing clear instructions
- providing reference texts
- splitting tasks into subtasks
- giving GPT 'time to think'
- using external tools


Some general techniques are:

- **Numbered Steps:**: For sequential tasks, use numbered steps. This helps the model understand the sequence of actions.

- **Use delimiters:** To separate various parts of the prompt (e.g. `"`, \`,, `'`, `|`, `#`, ...).


- **Few-shot prompting:** Provide a few examples for guidance.
  
 
- **Give the LLM a role:** Make the model assume a role. For example, instruct the model to `act like a tutor` or `you are an expert programmer.`
  
  
- **Iterate and refine prompts:** Often, you won't get your desired result straight away. Improve your prompting strategy iteratively, and then once you are happy, choose your final prompt and use it in a new chat session.


Combining these techniques, a template prompt might look like this:

:::{.callout-tip}
## Template
1) Role: who is being simulated?
2) Task: what is to be done?
3) Steps: what are the steps to complete the task?
4) Context: what is the context of the task?
5) Goal: what is the goal of the task?
6) Format: what is the format of the output? How long should it be?
:::

Remember to structure your prompt in a way that is clear and easy to understand. You can use markdown to format your prompt, and you instruct the mode to format its response using markdown.


## Examples

### Adopt a persona


:::{.callout-note}
## {{< bi person >}} Prompt:
You are an expert on the topic of university education and didactics. Explain the concept of "flipped classroom" to a group of teachers. Use markdown to format your response. Keep you explanation concise and to the point.
:::


Now let's try a different persona:


:::{.callout-note}
## {{< bi person >}} Prompt:
You are 13 year old high school student. Explain the concept of "flipped classroom" to your friends. Use markdown to format your response. Keep you explanation concise and to the point.
:::





### Reference texts

:::{.callout-note}
## {{< bi person >}} Prompt:
You will be provided with 

- context: documents delimited by **triple quotes**
- a question 

Your task is to provide a simplified answer to the question using only the provided document and to cite the passage(s) of the document used to answer the question. If the document does not contain the information needed to answer this question then simply write: "Insufficient information." If an answer to the question is provided, it must be annotated with a citation. Use the following format for to cite relevant passages ({"citation": â€¦}). Cite only the relevant sentence(s) of the document, not the entire document.

**Document 1**: '''The flipped classroom intentionally shifts instruction to a learner-centered model, in which students are often initially introduced to new topics outside of school, freeing up classroom time for the exploration of topics in greater depth, creating meaningful learning opportunities.'''

**Document 2**:'''With a flipped classroom, 'content delivery' may take a variety of forms, often featuring video lessons prepared by the teacher or third parties, although online collaborative discussions, digital research, and text readings may alternatively be used. The ideal length for a video lesson is widely cited as eight to twelve minutes.'''


**Question**: What is a good length for a video?
:::




Try asking a question that cannot be answered with the provided documents:

:::{.callout-note}
## {{< bi person >}} Prompt:
You will be provided with 

- context: documents delimited by **triple quotes**
- a question 

Your task is to provide a simplified answer to the question using only the provided document and to cite the passage(s) of the document used to answer the question. If the document does not contain the information needed to answer this question then simply write: "Insufficient information." If an answer to the question is provided, it must be annotated with a citation. Use the following format for to cite relevant passages ("SOURCE": â€¦). Cite only the relevant sentence(s) of the document, not the entire document.

**Document 1**:'''The flipped classroom intentionally shifts instruction to a learner-centered model, in which students are often initially introduced to new topics outside of school, freeing up classroom time for the exploration of topics in greater depth, creating meaningful learning opportunities.'''

**Document 2**:'''With a flipped classroom, 'content delivery' may take a variety of forms, often featuring video lessons prepared by the teacher or third parties, although online collaborative discussions, digital research, and text readings may alternatively be used. The ideal length for a video lesson is widely cited as eight to twelve minutes.'''


**Question**: Can you recommend a good book on the topic of flipped classrooms?
:::



### Structured output

You can also use prompts to instruct the model to produce structured output. For example, you can ask the model to give you a table.

:::{.callout-note}
## {{< bi person >}} Prompt:
You are a high school teacher. Give me a table containing Greek letters in one column, their pronunciation in the second column, and examples of usage in the third column. Give me a maximum of 6 rows.
