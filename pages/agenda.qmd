<!-- In this workshop, we will investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained, how they produce text, and what they are capable of. We will also discuss similarities and differences between LLMs and human thought processes. As LLMs become increasingly human-like in their performance, it is important to develop effective ways to describe their behaviour. We will discuss high-level concepts that allow us think about LLMs without falling into the trap of anthropomorphism. -->

## {{< bi house-door >}} Take-home messages

- Explore LLMs firsthand to understand their strengths and weaknesses.
- Combine domain knowledge with an understanding of how LLMs work, and effective prompting strategies.
- Integrate LLMs into teaching to foster AI literacy among students.
- Critically evaluate an LLM’s output. They are language models, not knowledge bases. 
- Keep a human in the loop.

:::{.callout-tip}
## After this workshop, you will be able to:

1) Explain what large language models and conversational agents, such as ChatGPT, can be used for, and what they shouldn't be used for.
2) Create effective prompts for LLMs.
<!-- 3) Design your own LLM-based educational activities.
4) Critically evaluate LLM-based educational activities. -->
