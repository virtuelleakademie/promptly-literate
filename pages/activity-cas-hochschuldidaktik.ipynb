        "Some general techniques are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Numbered Steps:**: For sequential tasks, use numbered steps. This helps the model understand the sequence of actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Use delimiters:** To separate various parts of the prompt (e.g. `\"`, \\`,, `'`, `|`, `#`, ...).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Few-shot prompting:** Provide a few examples for guidance.\n",
        "  \n",
        " \n",
        "- **Give the LLM a role:** Make the model assume a role. For example, instruct the model to `act like a tutor` or `you are an expert programmer.`\n",
        "  \n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Iterate and refine prompts:** Often, you won't get your desired result straight away. Improve your prompting strategy iteratively, and then once you are happy, choose your final prompt and use it in a new chat session.\n",

        "**Sollten Schulnoten abgeschafft werden?**\n",
        "\n",
        "In unserer heutigen Bildungswelt gibt es viele verschiedene Methoden, um den Fortschritt und das Wissen eines SchÃ¼lers zu messen. Eine der gebrÃ¤uchlichsten Methoden sind Schulnoten. Aber sollten wir wirklich Noten verwenden, um den Wert eines SchÃ¼lers zu bestimmen? Ich glaube, dass Noten in Schulen abgeschafft werden sollten, und hier sind meine GrÃ¼nde dafÃ¼r:\n",
        "\n",
        "Erstens, Noten sind oft subjektiv. Verschiedene Lehrer haben unterschiedliche Meinungen darÃ¼ber, was eine \"A\" -Arbeit im Vergleich zu einer \"B\" -Arbeit ist. Ein SchÃ¼ler kÃ¶nnte in einem Fach bei einem Lehrer eine \"A\" bekommen und bei einem anderen Lehrer eine \"B\". Dies zeigt, dass Noten nicht immer ein genaues Bild von dem Wissen eines SchÃ¼lers geben.\n",
        "\n",
        "Zweitens, Noten erzeugen unnÃ¶tigen Druck. Viele SchÃ¼ler fÃ¼hlen sich durch die Noten, die sie bekommen, gestresst und Ã¼berfordert. Dieser Druck kann zu AngstzustÃ¤nden, Depressionen und anderen gesundheitlichen Problemen fÃ¼hren. Wenn es keine Noten gÃ¤be, kÃ¶nnten sich die SchÃ¼ler mehr auf das Lernen konzentrieren und weniger darauf, eine bestimmte Note zu bekommen.\n",
        "\n",
        "Drittens, durch die Abschaffung von Noten kÃ¶nnten SchÃ¼ler mehr Freiheit in ihrer Bildung haben. Sie kÃ¶nnten Themen studieren, die sie wirklich interessieren, anstatt sich darauf zu konzentrieren, welche Themen ihnen die besten Noten bringen wÃ¼rden. Dies kÃ¶nnte zu einer besseren und umfassenderen Bildung fÃ¼hren.\n",
        "\n",
        "Einige kÃ¶nnten argumentieren, dass Noten notwendig sind, um den Fortschritt eines SchÃ¼lers zu messen. Aber es gibt viele andere MÃ¶glichkeiten, den Fortschritt zu messen, wie zum Beispiel Portfolios, PrÃ¤sentationen oder Projekte. Diese Methoden kÃ¶nnten ein genaueres Bild von dem Wissen und den FÃ¤higkeiten eines SchÃ¼lers geben.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abschliessend glaube ich, dass Schulnoten mehr Schaden als Nutzen bringen. Sie sind oft subjektiv, erzeugen unnÃ¶tigen Druck und beschrÃ¤nken die Freiheit der SchÃ¼ler. Es ist an der Zeit, dass wir ein neues System finden, um den Fortschritt und das Wissen unserer SchÃ¼ler zu messen.\n",
