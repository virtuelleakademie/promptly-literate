## Activity 1


In this activity, you can explore various prompting guides for GPT models. They more or less all converge on the same set of techniques.

## Activity 2

- Explore prompting, using both ChatGPT and the Playground. 
- Try the PromptTools Playground.
- Try out SPARK. This is a good demonstration of using a knowledge base and document retrieval can allow you to create a QA tool.
