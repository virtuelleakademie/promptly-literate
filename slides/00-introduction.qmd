<!-- ## Key messages

1) üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Keep a human in the loop: LLMs should be used to augment human writing, not to replace it.

2) This workshop is mainly about prompting. We can think about prompting as a way of "programming" LLMs, i.e. getting LLMs to do what we want them to do. -->

## What is ChatGPT?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="34%"}
![](../assets/images/Language%20Model.png){width=100%}
:::

::: {.column width="66%"}
- Consists of a **base** model and an **assistant** model.
- **Base or foundation** model: probabilistic model of how language is generated.
- **Assistant**: able to create human-like dialogue.
:::

## Base model

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="34%"}

:::

- Is trained to predict text. 

:::{.callout-note}
{{< fa person >}}: What is the capital of France?

{{< fa robot >}}: What is the capital of Germany? What is the capital of Italy? ...
:::

- Extracts various types of knowledge from text: linguistic, factual, commonsense, etc.
- Does not know how to have a conversation.

:::
::::

## Base model

Produces text that most likely follows the input (prompt).

:::{.callout-note}
{{< fa person >}}: The first person to walk on the Moon was

{{< fa robot >}}: Neil Armstrong
:::

:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Does an LLM know facts?

What we are really asking: 
Given what it learned during training, what words are most likely to follow _"The first person to walk on the Moon was "_? A good reply to this question is _"Neil Armstrong"_.
  
:::

## Base model: emergent properties

- LLMs are thought to show emergent properties - abilities not explicitly programmed into the model, but emerge as a result of text prediction.
  - performing arithmetic, answering questions, summarizing text, translating, etc.
  - zero-shot learning: LLMs can perform tasks without being trained on them.
  - few-shot learning: LLMs can perform tasks with few examples.



## Assistant model

- Is trained to create human-like dialogue. 

:::{.callout-note}
{{< fa person >}}: What is the capital of France?
{{< fa robot >}}: Paris. Is there anything else you would like to know about France?
:::

- Trained to have conversations: turn-taking, question answering, not being [rude/sexist/racist], etc.

:::
::::

## Knowledge base

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="34%"}
![](../assets/images/KnowledgeBase.png){width=100%}

:::

::: {.column width="66%"}
- A knowledge base is a collection of facts about the world.
- `Ask` and `Tell`
- I can ask but I can't tell.
- It cannot give me verifiable facts.

:::

::: {.column width="64%"}

- Can't tell me where it got its information from.
- LLMs are models of knowledge bases, but not knowledge bases themselves.
- Expensive/difficult to update with new knowledge.
- Produce ethically questionable results.

## An LLM is a role-play simulator

:::

::: {.column width="64%"}

:::{.callout-note}
We can think of an LLM as a non-deterministic simulator capable of role-playing an infinity of characters, or, to put it another way, capable of stochastically generating an infinity of simulacra [@shanahanRolePlayLargeLanguage2023]

## An LLM is a role-play simulator

- An assistant is trained to respond to user prompts in a human-like way.
- A simulator of **possible** human conversation.
- Has no intentions. It is not an entity with its own goals.
- Does not have a "personality" or "character" in the traditional sense. It can be thought of as a role-playing simulator.
- Has no concept of "truth" or "lying". The model is not trying to deceive the user, it is simply trying to respond in a human-like way.

![](../assets/images/simulator.png){width=100%}

:::{.callout-note}
- The dialogue agent will do its best to role-play a character in a dialogue.
- At every step, the model is trying to generate text that is most likely to follow the input. 
- It can take many different paths. Your interaction is just one of those possible paths.
