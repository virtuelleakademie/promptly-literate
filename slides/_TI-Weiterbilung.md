## Bund Article: This Image is Fake

- First of all: Cheating and falsifying is human…
- China, for example, has integrated a financial incentive system into its scientific institutions…
- Young researchers are under pressure, they want to do a postdoc in the West… publish as much as possible…
- AI can write a text for us, which is problematic if we then claim to have written the text ourselves.

## Interview with a Fraud Investigator

- University World News: Universities issue own rules to curb AI-assisted theses

## Hallucination (Confabulation): LLMs are Language Models, Not Knowledge Bases

- How Reliable Are Answers?
- Explainability
- Unclear What Cognitive Abilities LLMs Possess
- Prompting: 
  - Seemingly simple, but LLMs are difficult to control
  - Various Techniques (without theoretical background)
  - Bad practice in software engineering
  - Consistency: Will my prompt still work in 2 months?

---

## Limitations

- Hallucination: retrieval-augmented generation
- Hand-crafted prompts: prompt optimization with DSPy

---

## Solutions

---

## Future Developments

---

## AI in Education

- Approach of Clark and Chalmers (1998): cognitive processes can extend to external objects.
  - Complementary vs. Competitive Cognitive Artifacts
    - Complementary: Numbers, Abacus
    - Competitive: Calculator, GPS

---

## Extended Cognition

---

## Skill Loss?

---

## Deskilling

- Writing is a Core Competency: critical thinking, persuasiveness, argumentation, understanding.
- Text Creation is Secondary in Learning: focus is on underlying skills.
- Learning Objectives: clearly and convincingly communicate the benefits of writing tasks.
- Equip Students for Effective (Controlled) Use of AI.

---

## Writing Tasks in the Age of AI

- AI Can Do Homework
- Cheating also means: “bypassing useful cognition”
  - Encyclopedias, Calculators, Translation Tools.
  - Identify Necessary Skills (e.g., ChatGPT formats LaTeX)
  - Writing is Thinking; essential for developing competencies.
  - Controlled Use of Tools is Good, Prohibition is Impossible.
  - Focus on Developing Writing Skills.

---

## Avoiding Cheating or Useful Cognition

## Controlled Use of LLMs

  - Editing Tasks
    - Create/Improve Different Versions of Sections.
  - Transitions
    - Write and Compare Transitions.
  - Improve Drafts
    - Critique and Refine Drafts.
  - Writing Styles
    - Rewrite Sections for Different Audiences.
  - Controversial Statements
    - Identify Controversial Points and Strengthen Arguments.
  - Research Journal
    - Keep a Diary and Use LLM for Reflection.

## Technological Advances: Sport vs. Writing

- Swimsuits 
  - (LZR Racer)
- AI Writing Tools
  - Improvement
    - Reduced Resistance, Increased Buoyancy
    - Improved Grammar, Formulation, Content Creation
  - Fairness
    - Provided an Unfair Advantage, Led to Record Performances
    - Considered Unfair in Academic Contexts
  - Impact
    - Banned to Maintain Competitive Integrity
    - Raises Questions of Originality and Skill Development
  - Training vs Competition

---

## AI and Academic Integrity

---

## Understanding the Value of Effort

- Cheating can be a Symptom that Learners do not Understand or Appreciate the Value of Their Own Work.
  - Like Training: If we take shortcuts, we won’t get fit. Understanding the Purpose is Important to Endure Discomfort.
  - Learners Must Be Clear on What They Are Learning, Why It is Valuable, and Why Effort and Discomfort Are Necessary.

---

## Fraud Triangle

- Opportunity
- Rationalization
- Incentive
  - Example: Ghostwriting

---

## What Learning Environments Promote Cheating?

- High Pressure
  - High Stakes Increase Cheating. Fear of Failure Reinforces This.
- Lack of Intrinsic Motivation
  - Engagement and Relevance Are Important. Lacking These Makes Cheating More Attractive.
- Perceived Injustice
  - Unfair Grading Leads to Cheating.
- Low Fear of Getting Caught
  - Low Risk Encourages Cheating.
- Peer Influence
  - Widespread Cheating Among Peers Pressures Students to Join In.
- Low Self-Efficacy
  - Doubts About One’s Own Abilities Increase Cheating as the Seemingly Only Option.

---

## Strategies to Reduce Cheating

- Foster Intrinsic Motivation
  - Spark Genuine Interest. Provide Choices and Practical Applications.
- Mastery Learning
  - Clear Learning Objectives. Focus on Mastery of Content. Include Constructive and Corrective Feedback in Formative Assessments.
- Reduce Pressure
  - Diversify Assessment Methods. Use Portfolios and Low-Stress Tests to Reduce Anxiety.
- Strengthen Self-Efficacy
  - Provide Constructive Feedback and Promote Peer Learning (Peer Tutoring, Peer Review).
- Create a Culture of Integrity
  - Open Discussion About Academic Integrity. Set Clear Guidelines and Promote Community Ethics.

---

## Academic Integrity: Plagiarism

- Unattributed Use
  - Using the Work or Ideas of Others Without Proper Attribution.
- Minor Changes or Translations
  - Using the Work of Others with Minor Changes or Translations Without Attribution.
- Self-Plagiarism
  - Reusing Substantial Parts of One’s Own Work Without Proper Citation.
- Joint Works
  - Reusing Jointly Written Publications Without Proper Acknowledgment.

---

## Academic Integrity: Misconduct in Authorship

- False Authorship
  - Claiming Authorship Without Significant Contribution.
- Omission of Contributors
  - Failing to Mention Significant Contributors.
- Misleading Author Order
  - Order of Authors That Does Not Accurately Reflect Actual Contributions.

---

## Example APA Style: How to Cite Software, Not Personal Communication.

- How to Cite ChatGPT


  - Specifying Prompt Works Well Only for Inexperienced Users.
  - Experienced Users Work with Dialogues, Not Monolithic Prompts.
  - Working with Copilot (Code): No Traceable Prompt Input.
  - Listing Used Prompts May Inadequately Reflect Complex Processes.

---

## Proposal: Process Documentation

- Include Used Tools and Steps in Appendix, with Optional Graphical Representation. Serves Both Evaluation and Self-Reflection.
- Is Documentation Meaningful in the Long Term if AI (Copilot) Becomes the Norm?

---

## Academic Integrity: Documenting AI

- Useful with Heuristics: "delve", "vibrant", "embark", "it's important to note", "based on the data provided”.
- Not Useful with Detection Tools.

---

## Overconfident AI detectors
According to @fleckensteinTeachersSpotAI2024a

- Generative AI Can Write Papers That Are Undetectable.
- Teachers Overestimate Their Detection Abilities.

- Guidelines
- Framework Conditions:
  - Competencies
  - Infrastructure
  - Responsibility
  - Resources / Costs
